# ToDo List for Job Board:

## Things I would like to get done before Demo Day:
- [x] Create a sitemap
- [x] Prohibit logged-in companies from accessing new company page while signed-in
- [ ] Create an RSS feed
- [x] Ajax for pagination
- [x] Create a 'Forgot Password' and 'Remember Me' function for users
- [x] Theme the app with a user-friendly layout and easy navigation menu
- [x] Friendly URLs
- [x] Check the security
- [ ] Run a battery of tests
- [ ] Get it up and running with stripe (lofty... but not likely)
