# ToDo List for Job Board:

## Things I would like to get done before Demo Day:
- [x] Create a sitemap
- [ ] Prohibit logged-in companies from accessing new company page while signed-in
- [ ] Create an RSS feed
- [ ] Ajax for pagination
- [x] Create a 'Forgot Password' and 'Remember Me' function for users
- [ ] Theme the app with a user-friendly layout and easy navigation menu
- [ ] Friendly URLs
- [ ] Check the security
- [ ] Run a battery of tests
- [ ] Get it up and running with stripe (lofty... but not likely)
