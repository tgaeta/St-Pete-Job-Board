- [ ] Ajax for pagination
- [ ] Create a 'Forgot Password' and 'Remember Me' function for users
- [ ] Theme the app with a user-friendly layout and easy navigation menu
- [ ] Friendly URLs
- [ ] Check the security
- [ ] Run a battery of tests
- [ ] Get it up and running with stripe (lofty... but not likely)
